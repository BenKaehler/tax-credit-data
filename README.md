# TAX CREdiT: TAXonomic ClassifieR Evaluation Tool

This repository contains all non-code data from the [tax-credit](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/tax-credit) project, a standardized and extensible evaluation framework for bioinformatic methods.

Taxonomy classifications are not included in this repository, but precomputed evaluation results are. That is all that should be necessary for comparing previous results to new methods or new data sets unless if new evaluation methods are added.

Please see [tax-credit](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/tax-credit) for usage and citation information.
